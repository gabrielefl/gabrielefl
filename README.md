👋 Hello, World!
I'm Gabriele, a Biologist and passionate Tech Explorer 🚀 who loves diving into new solutions for the living world and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

🧠 What keeps my brain active:
Programming: Just starting to explore the world of coding.
Bioinformatics/Biotech: Merging my love for biology 🧬 and technology 💻 (because why not?)
Health Tech: Can code heal us? 🤔
🤖 Current mission:
"Trying to write code that works on the first try... just like everyone else." 😅

⚡ Fun fact:
I once thought debugging was like solving mysteries 🔍... until I realized I’m the one creating them. 😅

🌱 On a quest:
To combine Tech and Biology to build solutions that make a difference in people's lives. Oh, and avoid the existential dread of breaking everything with a single line of code.

📫 How to reach me:
Feel free to ping me if you want to chat about programming languages, bioinformatics tools, machine learning, or just share a funny meme.
